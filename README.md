## Version 1.1.0-alpha. Lean Library branch.

This version was taken from https://bitbucket.org/killeriukas/unityminigameframework/src/lean_library/.
The whole template can be found at https://github.com/killeriukas/UnityTemplate.

This repository was created to make it easier to download the library even in a zip file. No git software is required. However, this is **not** an up-to-date version.

Preferably the newest version can be found at the links above.
